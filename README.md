## Bayes Error Project  

I will be  running simulation-based comparisons of different methods of estimating Bayes Error Rate performance bounds under various conditions, including different sample sizes, numbers of dimensions, and distribution types. I will also be generating visualizations to summarize performance differences and reporting on the results of these simulations. I am expected to work an average of 20 hours a week in this position.

### Code description

I am going to try and provide up to date code descriptions of in the software manual
