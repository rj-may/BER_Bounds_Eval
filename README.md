## Bayes Error Project  

I will be responsible for running simulation-based comparisons of different methods of estimating Bayes Error Rate performance bounds under various conditions, including different sample sizes, numbers of dimensions, and distribution types. I will also be responsible for generating visualizations to summarize performance differences and reporting on the results of these simulations. As part of this, I am expected to review the relevant literature on different estimation methods to help interpret these findings and compare results with previous research. I am expected to work an average of 20 hours a week in this position.
